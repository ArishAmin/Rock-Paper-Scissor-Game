  - `Mrugesh`: Adapts to the most frequent moves.
  - `Kris`: Predicts counters based on previous moves.
  - `Abbey`: Tracks sequence probabilities.
- **Human vs. Computer Option**: Play against AI using a human input mode.
- **Random Mode**: Play against a random AI.
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures the `player` function consistently beats predefined strategies.
